This took me quite long to pin-point how to reproduce this, but I believe crucial part I was missing is second test in suite mounting same component.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Run your unit tests

```
npm run test:unit
```
